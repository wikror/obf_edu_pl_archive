As a result of the cross-pollination of ideas, naturalised epistemology has come to include a great richness of methodologies and approaches.<\/p>\n<p>While the workshop is focussed upon naturalised epistemology it is open to discussions of naturalism in general and past papers have discussed naturalised approaches to the philosophies of science, language, mind, logic and law. This year we&#8217;re focussing upon approaches based on research into artificial cognitive systems or comparing artificial and natural systems.<\/p>\n<p>The workshop brings together a number of leading experts with post-graduates and researchers. Over the five days, the speakers lead discussions that focus on issues dealing arising out of their work and dealing with naturalised epistemology.<\/p>\n<p>A special stress will be on the relationship of naturalised epistemology and research on artificial cognitive systems in such areas as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>concepts of functions in artifacts and natural systems (Ulrich Krohs)<\/li>\n<li>referring to artifacts (Hilary Kornblith)<\/li>\n<li>semiotic abilities of machines and living systems (Donald Favareau)<\/li>\n<li>problems of categorisation, sensorimotor bases of symbols, and symbol grounding in artificial intelligence (Stevan Harnad)<\/li>\n<li>mental states of non-human agents and internalism\/externalism debate in research on cognitive systems (Hilary Kornblith), and<\/li>\n<li>naturalising logical knowledge for agents (Maria Frappoli).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>This is the third KNEW that has been organised. The previous meetings (2005 and 2006) included talks by Mark Bickhard, Michael Bishop, Werner Callebaut, John Collier, Andrzej Klawiter, Jonathan Knowles, Huw Price, Bjorn Ramberg and Franz Wuketits.<\/p>\n<p>KNEW&#8217;07 is being organised by Marcin Milkowski (PAN, CPR) and Konrad Talmont-Kaminski (KLI, UMCS, CPR). This workshop is partly founded by the euCognition network (www.eucognition.org).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>CALL FOR PAPERS<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We invite submissions (by short abstract) of papers in naturalised epistemology and related areas.
