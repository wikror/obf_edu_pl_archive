The aim of the workshop is to explore this potential  by examining questions such as: What kinds of new philosophical  questions regarding religion can now be meaningfully pursued? What is  the significance, if any, of the current research for traditional issues in philosophy of religion? Is there scope for a new, naturalist  philosophy of religion? Or is it simply that philosophy of religion has  come to an end? <\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"> <b>Abstracts<\/b> <\/p>\n<p align=\"left\"> Abstracts of less than 500 words will be accepted till <b>March 31st<\/b>. All submissions should be made through the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.easychair.org\/conferences\/?conf=knew12\" target=\"_self\">easychair website<\/a>.
