A minibus will be organised to take workshop participants from Warsaw to Kazimierz and back at the start and end of the workshop. If arriving on a different date, it will be necessary to make your own way down to Kazimierz.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Apart from the minibus, the easiest way to reach Kazimierz from Warsaw is by train to <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.google.com\/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=pulawy,+poland&amp;z=11\" target=\"_self\">Pulawy<\/a> and then either by taxi or by bus to Kazimierz. The trains to Pulawy run from the Warsaw Central station every two and a half hours or so (if arriving at the airport, the best way to reach the central station is by bus 175 or the rail link &#8211; the ticket is 3.40 PLN). It is best to use the <a href=\"http:\/\/rozklad-pkp.pl\/bin\/query.exe\/en?\" target=\"_self\">on-line rail route planner<\/a> (leaving 'Warszawa Centralna&#8217; arriving 'Pulawy Miasto&#8217;) to find out the exact times the trains run. The cost of the rail ticket is under 30 PLN in second class and under 45 PLN in first class.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">The most convenient connection between the Central (or Zachodnia) train station from the Warsaw airport is the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.lotnisko-chopina.pl\/en\/passenger\/access-and-car-parks\/train\/train?cl=en&amp;set_language=en\" target=\"_self\">rail link<\/a>. To plan your journey from the airport to Pu\u0142awy using the online rail route planner, enter &#8222;Warszawa Lotnisko Chopina&#8221; as the beginning of the journey.<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">In Pulawy there is a taxi stand just outside the station. The trip to Kazimierz is only 14 km (about 35 PLN).<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Another way to get to Kazimierz Dolny is by a direct minibus. Most minibuses start from a stop &#8222;Plac Defilad&#8221;, which is opposite the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw &#8212; a short walk from the main train station (Warszawa Centralna or \u015ar\u00f3dmie\u015bcie, if you&#8217;re using the airport train link). You can find the online bus planner\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/en.e-podroznik.pl\/\" target=\"_self\">here<\/a>. The drive takes around 3 hours, and buses usually sell tickets directly (one has to pay in cash, the price is around 30 PLN).<\/p>\n<p align=\"justify\">An important tip: Do not, by mistake, go to the 'other&#8217; Kazimierz, which is a suburb of Krak\u00f3w.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"excerpt","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"episode_type":"","audio_file":"","cover_image":"","cover_image_id":"","duration":"","filesize":"","date_recorded":"","explicit":"","block":"","filesize_raw":"","spay_email":"","jetpack_publicize_message":"","jetpack_is_tweetstorm":false,"jetpack_publicize_feature_enabled":true},"categories":[22],"tags":[],"aioseo_notices":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","jetpack_publicize_connections":[],"jetpack_sharing_enabled":true,"jetpack_shortlink":"https:\/\/wp.me\/p5jayp-3C","jetpack-related-posts":[{"id":273,"url":"http:\/\/obf.edu.pl\/economics-and-naturalism-kazimierz-naturalism-workshop-2010\/","url_meta":{"origin":224,"position":0},"title":"Economics and Naturalism: Kazimierz Naturalism Workshop 2010","date":"6 kwietnia 2010","format":false,"excerpt":"Kazimierz Dolny, Poland\u2013 September 11th-15th, 2010Invited key speakers Ken Binmore (UCL)Erik Angner (Alabama at Birmingham)Christophe Heintz (CEU) Until recently, economics has stood apart from the other social sciences due to its aprioristic methodology and assumptions.
