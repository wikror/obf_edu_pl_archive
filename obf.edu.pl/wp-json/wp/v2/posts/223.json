One of the areas naturalism has been focussing upon is the mind, traditionally viewed as a topic hard to reconcile with the naturalistic worldview. A number of questions have been pursued in this context. What is the place of the mind in the world? How\u00a0 should study we the mind as a natural phenomenon? What is the significance of cognitive science research for philosophical debates? The workshop aims to further the development of a naturalistic view of the mind through focussed, friendly discussion undertaken in the relaxed atmosphere of a picturesque historical town.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><b>Call for Papers<\/b><\/p>\n<div align=\"justify\">300 word abstracts are invited no later than May 30<sup>th<\/sup> and should be accompanied by application forms &#8211; people whose talks are not accepted will have the opportunity to withdraw their applications.
