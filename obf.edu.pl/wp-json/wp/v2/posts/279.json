One of the key issues regarding representation concerns the possible varieties of representation: what are various ways of representing?

What consequences does a pluralist attitude to representation have for claims that animals and even plants are capable of representing?<\/p>\n<p>Call for Papers<\/p>\n<p>300 word abstracts are invited no later than June 30.
