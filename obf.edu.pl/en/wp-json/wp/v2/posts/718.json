Individual studies, such as attempts to explain aesthetic responses in terms of some aspect of human neurology, have at times been deemed reductionist. Quite apart from such \u2018accusations\u2019 often being wholehearted accepted by researchers, the overall picture of art that science is revealing is anything from simplistic. Instead, research coming out of a variety of disciplines is presenting philosophy with ever new challenges if it is to provide anything like an integrated understanding of art and music. Thus, among others, ecological approaches provide a novel perspective upon meaning in music, embodied approaches explore the role of the specific played by the body in experiencing music and evolutionary approaches examine the significance of human evolutionary history for art and music. Far from being simplified, the view that tended to focus upon cultural factors has been enriched by consideration of cognitive and evolutionary factors as well as novel tools and ways of thinking about the interplay between art and music and the broader cultures in which they exist. In effect, it is philosophy that is forced to extend its perspective in order to seek a synthesis that reflects the new research. In our workshop we will seek to further this process by engaging philosophers and scientists in a dialogue concerning the multifaceted place that art and music hold in nature.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Invited Key-speakers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mus.cam.ac.uk\/directory\/ian-cross\">Ian Cross (University of Cambridge)<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/ellendissanayake.com\/\">Ellen Dissanayake (University of Washington)\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/amu.academia.edu\/PiotrPrzybysz\">Piotr Przybysz (Adam Mickiewicz University)<\/a><br \/><strong><strong><br \/><\/strong><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Sample Questions<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To what extent recent neuroscientific findings explain the nature of our interactions with art and music?<\/li>\n<li>How can we relate empirical data from empirical musicology to evolutionary theories of music?<\/li>\n<li>What is the role of computational modelling of music cognition in our understanding of music (in evolutionary context)?<\/li>\n<li>To what degree can current neuroaesthetics explain the meaning of art and aesthetic pleasure?<\/li>\n<li>In what ways current naturalistic philosophy of science can inform recent debates on art and music?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Call for Papers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>300 word abstracts are invited no later than <strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/JFvujknrBuE\">August,\u00a030<\/a><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https:\/\/youtu.be\/JFvujknrBuE\">th (<\/a><\/span>extended deadline).\u00a0<\/strong>Accepted speakers will have 40 minutes for their presentations, including discussion time.
