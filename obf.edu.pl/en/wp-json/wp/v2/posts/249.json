While discussions over the appropriateness of naturalist assumptions are ongoing, many philosophers are simply forging ahead with a range of interdisciplinary projects that show how philosophy and various sciences such as biology, psychology and cognitive science can work hand in hand. The workshop aims to further the development of naturalism through focussed, friendly discussion in the relaxed atmosphere of a picturesque historical town.<\/p>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p><b>Call for Papers<\/b><\/p>\n<p>300 word abstracts are invited no later than April 30<sup>th<\/sup> and should be accompanied by application forms (doc\/pdf) &#8211; people whose talks are not accepted will have the opportunity to withdraw their applications.
